	<h1>1.) Review the PEMDAS.</h1>
	
	<p>The PEMDAS Rule is a set of rules that prioritize the order of calculations, that is, which operation to perform first. Otherwise, it is possible to get multiple or different answers. We donâ€™t want that to happen. </p>
	
	<h1>2.) Answer below: Explain how did you get the result.</h1>
	
	<p>The shoe is equivalent to 10. The kid is equivalent to 5 and the newspaper boquet is equivalent to 4.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Thus number 1 results in 30 because the 3 shoes is equals to 30.</li>
		<li>Number 2 results in 20 because the 2 kids and a shoe is equals to 20.</li>
		<li>Number 3 results in 13 because the 2 newspaper boquet and a kid is equals to 13.</li>
		<li>Last but not the least, the newspaper, the kid and the shoe is equals to 19.</li>
	</ul>
