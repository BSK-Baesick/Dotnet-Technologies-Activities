		Give me the number for 911! <br> Oh, so they have internet on computers now! <br>Bart, with $10,000, we’d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things  like...love!<br>Just because I don’t care doesn’t mean I don’t understand.<br> I’m normally not a praying man, but if you’re up there, please save me Superman.  <br>  Son, if you really want something in this life, you have to work for it. Now quiet! They’re about to announce the lottery numbers. <br> Well, it’s 1 a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids. <br> Maybe, just once, someone will call me ‘Sir’ without adding, ‘You’re making  a scene.’<br> Marge, don’t discourage the boy! Weaseling out of things is important to learn.  It’s what separates us from the animals! Except the weasel. <br> Doughnuts. Is there anything they can’t do? <br>
